# MatPDF-Companion
Materials science researchers often spend countless hours manually reviewing literature to extract synthesis conditions from MOF (Metal-Organic Framework) papers. This automated system solves that problem by intelligently parsing PDF research papers and extracting key experimental parameters into structured tables. The tool identifies and extracts critical synthesis information including compound names, metal sources, linker amounts, reaction conditions, and solvent details, transforming hours of manual work into minutes of automated processing.

The core functionality relies on a dual-model approach where an initial classifier determines whether document sections contain actual experimental procedures or just background information. Once relevant sections are identified, a sophisticated extraction model powered by Groq's Llama-3.1-70b processes the text to create standardized 11-column tables with all essential MOF synthesis parameters. Additionally, the system features a conversational interface built with Streamlit and Google's Gemini Pro, enabling researchers to query their processed documents naturally and retrieve specific information through semantic search.

Getting started requires obtaining API credentials from Groq and Google, then configuring them as environment variables named `GROQ_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. Simply point the system to a folder containing your MOF research papers in PDF format, and it will automatically process all documents, generate synthesis condition tables, and launch an interactive query interface. This tool is particularly valuable for literature reviews, comparative studies, and building comprehensive databases of MOF synthesis protocols from published research.
